# Mesh Manipulation in ThreeJS
[![Mesh Manipulation in ThreeJS](thumbnail.jpg)](https://www.blacklisteddev.com/_experiments/threejs/mesh_sphere/index.html)
This is the repository for my ThreeJS experiment. This experiment uses mouse events to modify the vertices and faces of a 3D object created in Blender and imported into ThreeJS as a JSON format.


This project also uses Gulp and Gulp Server for live reloads on the local server (http://localhost:8000)
